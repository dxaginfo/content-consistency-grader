# Content Consistency Grader

A web application that helps brands assess how consistently their messaging is delivered across different platforms.

## Concept

In today's fragmented media landscape, brands must maintain consistent messaging across multiple platforms while adapting to each platform's unique format and audience. The Content Consistency Grader provides an objective analysis of messaging consistency, helping brands identify where their communications may be diverging from core messaging.

## Features

- **Text Analysis**: Analyze content from different platforms to detect tone, sentiment, and keyword consistency
- **Consistency Scoring**: Generate an overall consistency score based on various linguistic metrics
- **Visual Reports**: View graphical representations of content consistency across platforms
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Get actionable recommendations to improve message consistency

## How It Works

1. Input your brand's messaging from different platforms (website, social media, email, etc.)
2. Our algorithm analyzes the text for tone, keywords, and brand voice consistency
3. Receive a "consistency score" and detailed breakdown of your results
4. Get specific recommendations for improving consistency across channels
